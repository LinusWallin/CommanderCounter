# CommanderCounter
An app for keeping track of player counters such as current life, commander damage taken, and more specific counters such as experience will be added later on.

## Building the Application
To build the application either use a emulator in Android Studio or connect your Android phone with developer options enabled to your computer. Then simply press build in Android Studio and you will have a working version of the application.

### Build Requirements
The minimum required sdk is Android sdk 30 (Android 11).

## Current Features
### Main Menu
The application has a main menu, where the user can select the number of players and the starting life total of the players. There is also an option for keeping the screen awake while the application is running.

### Game Screen
When the user presses play in the main menu, they are taken to the game screen where the life totals of the players are displayed. The game screen menu can be accessed by pressing the hamburger menu icon in the middle of the screen allowing the user to reset the game, go back to the main menu, or open the plane chase feature.
